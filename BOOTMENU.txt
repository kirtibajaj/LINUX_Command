LINUX BOOT PROCESS
When a system switched on and after few moment we get a login prompt. Have we try to find out what all stages of booting sequence has crossed and what happened behind the scene during system boots up.
Power on
BIOS(Basic input output system) is a software program comes pre built in a mother board chipset.
BIOS is used to load and scan for devices such as Harddisk, CD-ROM, RAM etc.
BIOS searches for MBR(Master boot record: 1st sector ) of the primary hard drive,it scans for 1st stage loader(In  our case boot loader is GRUB ,LILO)  and hands over the responsibility to MBR.
Boot PROM/FLASH/BIOS is profiecient of laoding to MBR into RAM and executing it.
MBR (MASTER BOOT RECORD)
512 bytes of space -> MBR
MBR contains the information of loader of most operating system e.g UNIX,LINUX and WINDOWS
MBR holds the small binary information of the first stage of loader.
MBR consist physical sector of first disk drive(i.e. 512 bytes) and it's not part of any partition 
placed on the prime disk drive , in the prime sector of the first cylinder of track is 0 and head is 0(this whole path is generally booked for boot programs)
MBR involve a mini executable programs and a table specify the primary partitions.
MBR also document which primary partition is ACTIVE.
The BIOS surrender rights to the first stage boot loader, which then scans partition table and finds second stage boot loader on the partition configured as bootable.
 BOOT LOADER
The boot loader termed from 1st stage loader and loads itself into RAM . ALL this go on in milliseconds.
The default stage 2 boot loader is a GRUB (GRAND UNIFIED BOOT LOADER) or LILO(Linux loader)
Once GRUB is loaded into RAM then it is search for the location of kernel 
GRUB is scrutinized the map file to find the kernel image, that is located under(/boot) and laod it
GRUB loads the kernel image, that is located under(/boot) and load it
GRUB loads the kernel(vmlinuz-version) from /boot partition
